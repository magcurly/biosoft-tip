#This is a file for FASTX TOOLKITS.

I have several problems during the installation.

First, libgtextutils.
Before installing the fastx toolkits, you have to install libgtextutils.
The problem is that you have to export the environmental variables as the README file of the FASTX TOOLKITS installation package told you.
Otherwise, it's IMPOSSIBLE that the ./configure can recognize that you have installed the library.

Like This way:
export GTEXTUTILS_LIBS=/path/to/your/libgtextutils/lib
export GTEXTUTILS_CFLAGS=/path/to/your/libgtextutils/include

Second, make.
I don't know whether this is the problem that I am not the root user of the system.
During the make step, when building with gtextutils library, it's not capable to carry on unless identifying the absolute path of the head files using in the cpp for building.
You have to change it like this:
#include </path/to/your/libgtextutils/include/gtextutils/gtextutils/stream_wrapper.h>
#include </path/to/your/libgtextutils/include/gtextutils/gtextutils/text_line_reader.h>
#include </path/to/your/libgtextutils/include/gtextutils/gtextutils/string_tokenize.h>
#include </path/to/your/libgtextutils/include/gtextutils/gtextutils/container_join.h>

This will happen in building fastx_uncollapser and fasta_formatter.

Third, still make.
I have no idea why this would come out.

ERROR happens as below:
/path/to/your/libgtextutils/lib: file not recognized: Is a directory
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [Makefile:414: fasta_formatter] Error 1

To solve this problem, you have to do the g++ step manually.
g++ -g -O2 -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wswitch-default -Wswitch-enum -Wunused-parameter -Wfloat-equal -Werror -DDEBUG -g -O1 -o fasta_formatter fasta_formatter.o /path/to/your/libgtextutils/lib/libgtextutils.a -I /path/to/your/libgtextutils/include ../libfastx/libfastx.a -L/path/to/your/libgtextutils/lib

ESPECIALLY, THIS FILE!
/path/to/your/libgtextutils/lib/libgtextutils.a
The make step couldn't automatically identify this file and have to add this file by yourselves!

This is the end of this installation tips of fastx toolkits.

If you have better suggestions, please add a comment.

Yours,
