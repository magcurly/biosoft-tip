Some tips about Biosoft-install

Haha!
It's fabulous to use conda to manage your environment!
Conda can do everything!
I've got my R done with conda on the server!
However, I don't know what happens to my WSL, while conda could not fix it when installing R.
Still no idea.

This is a collection of tips for software installation.
I notice that some problems occur during installation but I can't find a proper solution for them.
Therefore, I create this repository with a collection of tips and files to solve the problems.

I will renew this repository when I meet problems during software installation and use.

This may be not useful for most people, but it's a record of what I have done and how I have solved problems.

If you guys have better suggestions, please add a comment. It's highly welcome.
Please don't hack my email or my account.

Besides, I am not good at English writing. Please don't make fun of my words.
